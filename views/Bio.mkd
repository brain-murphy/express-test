## Bio

I am not sure whether this page will be purely 'bio'graphical; it will certainly
focus on my identity as a computer scientist or, if that sounds too pretentious,
software developer. Let's just call it my computer science biography.

## Education

I am a currently studying computer science at Georgia Tech.
No, I mean right now -- I am currently sitting in a computer science class as
I write. Georgia Tech classes are interesting and challenging, but (pardon the
clich√©) most of my education has occurred outside the classroom.

The College of Computing has kept me contentedly busy with their large spread of
unusually specialized clubs. Because of my initial Android bent,
my primary focus is the GITMAD club, or the Georgia Institute of Technology
Mobile Application Development club. I should note that I was recently elected
president of GITMAD, but I won't have anything concrete to say about that until
my first semester in that position is underway; we are going to try a different
approach to the club than was taken before, so wish us luck!

Additionally, I am a regular at GT Web Development club's hackathons, and take
what amounts to an additional three credit hours of CS lectures each week in the form of
GT Programming Team meetings.

## Skills

I began programming in high school, for the Android platform. Because of this,
I became a competent Java developer, which has been a useful tool in academia
as well as in side-projects. Knowledge of Java syntax biased me towards C#, which
has made the .NET platform my favorite technology, as of the time of writing.
Although using ASP.NET is a bit overkill for most of my web development projects,
I prefer it because its conventions force good project management practices. However, since
coming to college, I have picked up a bit of a JavaScript addiction. Because its
use in hackathons and side projects is nearly ubiquitous, I started using in
order to fit in, but I now truly understand its allure. I now see language features
where I used to see design oversights. You could say that I've been doing lines
of JavaScript ever since.

I use Git and GitHub/Bitbucket enthusiastically. Utility aside, doesn't it feel good
to push a commit and close an issue? In fact, this very website is a GitHub page!

At the behest of several of my professors, I began using Linux whenever practical,
and have no regrets about the matter. I wouldn't call myself a linux hacker yet, but beside my gains
of marginally increased productivity lies my improved knowledge of how client software,
the operating system, and the machine interact.

## Interests

I find that my professional interests mostly encompass subjects with which I
do not have a lot of prior knowledge. Thus, exploring my interests keeps them
changing. I often find myself getting 'nerd sniped' by frameworks that I've not
heard of before.

More broadly, I enjoy mobile development and web development, as those types
of projects tend to be very approachable and fun for small teams. As a student
working on small projects, most of my experience is in these areas.

Lately, I have become interested in the mix of scientific and, humanistic thought
that encompasses the study of artificial intelligence. Reading and thinking on the
subject has led me to [literature that has significantly altered my perspective
of the world](http://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-A-Brief-History-Humankind/dp/0062316095).
 I am currently pursuing a curriculum focus in artificial intelligence
as part of Georgia Tech's [Threads](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/threads-better-way-learn-cs)
system.

Any passage about my interests would be a lie by omission if it
did not make mention of music. Although I can find an artist to enjoy
in most genres, I have lately been exploring the genres of Neo-Folk/Folk-Rock
and Indie Pop. I enjoy modern folk music for the [particular emotional tone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcKnlhL97rs)
 that acoustic instruments excel in creating and its [lyrical density](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu21mCisNn0).
Indie is great because it is brash and bold; maybe I'm just buying into the concept
of indie music too much, but it seems as though indie pop artists make musical
decisions based more on what they think sounds hot than on what consumers have
made popular lately. It produces a lot of [strange stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWNIajNpsAA),
 but is often quite [compelling melodically](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpbN7pv2fiA),
 and [its originality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2GMQShkJYM) is refreshing.

## Mission Statement

In the next few years, I would like to gain depth in formal Computer Science
knowledge, and breadth in practical Computer Science skills. I have found that
I am interested not only in 'how to make a computer do things', but also in 'how
a computer does things'. I think that this knowledge base will provide a better
platform for me to pragmatically and creatively author the best solutions I can.

Additionally, I want to hone the communicational skills that facilitate good
teamwork. [With some exceptions](http://www.qwantz.com/comics/comic2-2857.png),
computers don't make mistakes; programmers make mistakes, and often because of
bad project management and communication practices. I feel confident that my
education will provide me with more than enough technical knowledge to be a good
software developer; my challenge will be to work through the hard-learned
lessons of practical software development that only experience can teach.

--And always, I want to learn more about the world (universe?). The more people I
meet, the more I am convinced that truly great minds are not effective because of
their horsepower alone; they are effective because of the large spectrum of information and observations
that they can synthesize into their perspective. I want such a perspective for
my life as well as for my work, so I don't limit my learning to only technical
topics -- I allow my curiosity to guide my intellectual activities.
